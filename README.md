# AI-Portfolio
Recently, I came across an Instagram reel about an AI tool called Bolt, which is gaining significant attention in the AI code generation industry. Unlike Replit Agent, Bolt offers a more contemporary user experience and enables developers and designers to create high-quality user interfaces in a fraction of the time.
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the remarkable progress that AI is making in developing simple applications that students like myself would typically spend three hours creating. 
However, Bolt can accomplish this task in just three minutes, which is truly astonishing.
Considering the potential topics I could have explored with AI, I decided to create a portfolio website for myself to compare the quality of my work. My findings revealed that while the website I created was aesthetically pleasing, it took me approximately three to four hours to build (I did utilize ChatGPT to assist with its construction). 
In contrast, Bolt generated a visually appealing and AI-generated webpage in just three minutes.
The central lesson from this comparison is that while AI can generate basic products that effectively perform their intended functions, creating personalized and distinctive applications requires dedicating time and effort. Planning the user interface for two hours and implementing it for two hours is still the most effective approach.
